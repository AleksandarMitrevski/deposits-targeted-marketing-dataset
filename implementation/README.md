# Implementation

## Dependencies

The following pip modules are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- tensorflow
- shap

To run on the GPU, Tensorflow requires [additional elaborate setup](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu). IPython and likely some script modifications will be needed to use browser-based rendering in SHAP.
